abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classi cation technique. However, beginners who are not familiar with SVM often get unsatisfactory results since they miss some easy but signi cant steps. In this guide, we propose a simple procedure which usually gives reasonable results. developed well-differentiated superficial transitional cell bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCI often prefer SPC than other methods offered to them, because of quality-of-life issues. The incidence of significant complications might not be as high as previously reported, and with a commitment to careful follow-up, SPC can be a safe option for carefully selected patients if adequate surveillance can be ensured.},
