abstract = {Bankruptcy prediction has drawn a lot of research interests in previous literature, and recent studies have shown that machine learning techniques achieved better performance than traditional statistical ones. This paper applies support vector machines (SVMs) to the bankruptcy prediction problem in an attempt to suggest a new model with better explanatory power and stability. To serve this purpose, we use a grid-search technique using 5-fold cross-validation to find out the optimal parameter values of kernel function of SVM. In addition, to evaluate the prediction accuracy of SVM, we compare its performance with those of multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), logistic regression analysis (Logit), and three-layer fully connected back-propagation neural networks (BPNs). The experiment results show that SVM outperforms the other methods. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Min2006b,
abstract = {Bankruptcy prediction is an important and widely studied topic since it can have significant impact on bank lending decisions and profitability. Recently, the support vector machine (SVM) has been applied to the problem of bankruptcy prediction. The SVM-based method has been compared with other methods such as the neural network (NN) and logistic regression, and has shown good results. The genetic algorithm (GA) has been increasingly applied in conjunction with other AI techniques such as NN and Case-based reasoning (CBR). However, few studies have dealt with the integration of GA and SVM, though there is a great potential for useful applications in this area. This study proposes methods for improvingSVMperformance in two aspects: feature subset selection and parameter optimization.GAis used to optimize both a feature subset and parameters of SVM simultaneously for bankruptcy prediction.},

abstract = {In this study, differential evolution algorithm (DE) is proposed to train a wavelet neural network (WNN). The resulting network is named as differential evolution trained wavelet neural network (DEWNN). The efficacy of DEWNN is tested on bankruptcy prediction datasets viz. US banks, Turkish banks and Spanish banks. Further, its efficacy is also tested on benchmark datasets such as Iris, Wine and Wisconsin Breast Cancer. Moreover, Garson's algorithm for feature selection in multi layer perceptron is adapted in the case of DEWNN. The performance of DEWNN is compared with that of threshold accepting trained wavelet neural network (TAWNN) [Vinay Kumar, K., Ravi, V., Mahil Carr, {\&} Raj Kiran, N. (2008). Software cost estimation using wavelet neural networks. Journal of Systems and Software] and the original wavelet neural network (WNN) in the case of all data sets without feature selection and also in the case of four data sets where feature selection was performed. The whole experimentation is conducted using 10-fold cross validation method. Results show that soft computing hybrids viz., DEWNN and TAWNN outperformed the original WNN in terms of accuracy and sensitivity across all problems. Furthermore, DEWNN outscored TAWNN in terms of accuracy and sensitivity across all problems except Turkish banks dataset. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{RaviKumar2007b,
abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of the work done, during the 1968-2005, in the application of statistical and intelligent techniques to solve the bankruptcy prediction problem faced by banks and firms. The review is categorized by taking the type of technique applied to solve this problem as an important dimension. Accordingly, the papers are grouped in the following families of techniques: (i) statistical techniques, (ii) neural networks, (iii) case-based reasoning, (iv) decision trees, (iv) operational research, (v) evolutionary approaches, (vi) rough set based techniques, (vii) other techniques subsuming fuzzy logic, support vector machine and isotonic separation and (viii) soft computing subsuming seamless hybridization of all the above-mentioned techniques. Of particular significance is that in each paper, the review highlights the source of data sets, financial ratios used, country of origin, time line of study and the comparative performance of techniques in terms of prediction accuracy wherever available. The review also lists some important directions for future research. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of several systems based on ensemble of classifiers for bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring. The obtained results are very encouraging, our results improved the performance obtained using the stand-alone classifiers. We show that the method "Random Subspace" outperforms the other ensemble methods tested in this paper. Moreover, the best stand-alone method is the multi-layer perceptron neural net, while the best method tested in this work is the Random Subspace of Levenberg-Marquardt neural net. In this work, three financial datasets are chosen for the experiments: Australian credit, German credit, and Japanese credit. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
