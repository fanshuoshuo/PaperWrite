abstract = {Corporate bankruptcy prediction is very important for creditors and investors. Most literature improves performance of prediction models by developing and optimizing the quantitative methods. This paper investigates the effect of sampling methods on the performance of quantitative bankruptcy prediction models on real highly imbalanced dataset. Seven sampling methods and five quantitative models are tested on two real highly imbalanced datasets. A comparison of model performance tested on random paired sample set and real imbalanced sample set is also conducted. The experimental results suggest that the proper sampling method in developing prediction models is mainly dependent on the number of bankruptcies in the training sample set. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In classification or prediction tasks, data imbalance problem is frequently observed when most of instances belong to one majority class. Data imbalance problem has received considerable attention in machine learning community because it is one of the main causes that degrade the performance of classifiers or predictors. In this paper, we propose geometric mean based boosting algorithm (GMBoost) to resolve data imbalance problem. GMBoost enables learning with consideration of both majority and minority classes because it uses the geometric mean of both classes in error rate and accuracy calculation. To evaluate the performance of GMBoost, we have applied GMBoost to bankruptcy prediction task. The results and their comparative analysis with AdaBoost and cost-sensitive boosting indicate that GMBoost has the advantages of high prediction power and robust learning capability in imbalanced data as well as balanced data distribution.},

@article{He2009b,
abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

@article{Wang2014b,
abstract = {With the recent financial crisis and European debt crisis, corporate bankruptcy prediction has become an increasingly important issue for financial institutions. Many statistical and intelligent methods have been proposed, however, there is no overall best method has been used in predicting corporate bankruptcy. Recent studies suggest ensemble learning methods may have potential applicability in corporate bankruptcy prediction. In this paper, a new and improved Boosting, FS-Boosting, is proposed to predict corporate bankruptcy. Through injecting feature selection strategy into Boosting, FS-Booting can get better performance as base learners in FS-Boosting could get more accuracy and diversity. For the testing and illustration purposes, two real world bankruptcy datasets were selected to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of FS-Boosting. Experimental results reveal that FS-Boosting could be used as an alternative method for the corporate bankruptcy prediction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A multi-label classification based approach for sentiment analysis is proposed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose to use multi-label classification for sentiment classification of microblogs. The proposed prototype has three main components, text segmentation, feature extraction, and multi-label classification. Raw segmented words and sentiment features based on the three different sentiment dictionaries, Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary, National Taiwan University Sentiment Dictionary and HowNet Dictionary, are the features and the bag of words is the feature representation. A detailed empirical study of different multi-label classification methods on sentiment classification is conducted to compare their classification performances. Specifically, total 11 state of the art multi-label classification methods are compared on two microblog datasets and 8 evaluation metrics are used. The effects of the three sentiment dictionaries for multi-label classification are empirically studied and compared, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been performed. The performed empirical comparisons show that Dalian University of Technology Sentiment Dictionary has the best performance among the three different sentiment dictionaries.},
