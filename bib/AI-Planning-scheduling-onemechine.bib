@article{Lenstra1977c,
abstract = {We survey and extend the results on the complexity of machine scheduling problems. After a brief review of the central concept of NP-completeness we give a classification of scheduling problems on single, different and identical machines and study the influence of various parameters on their complexity. The problems for which a polynomial-bounded algorithm is available are listed and NP-completeness is established for a large number of other machine scheduling problems. We finally discuss some questions that remain unanswered.},

@article{Lawler1973c,
abstract = {Suppose n jobs are each to be processed by a single machine, subject to arbitrary given precedence constraints. Associated with each job j is a known processing time a[SUBj] and a monotone nondecreasing cost function c[SUBj](t), giving the cost that is incurred by the completion of that job at time t. The problem is to find a sequence which will minimize the maximum of the incurred costs. An efficient computational procedure is given for this problem, generalizing and simplifying previous results of the present author and J. M. Moore. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
