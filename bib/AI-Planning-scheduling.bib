abstract = {We survey and extend the results on the complexity of machine scheduling problems. After a brief review of the central concept of NP-completeness we give a classification of scheduling problems on single, different and identical machines and study the influence of various parameters on their complexity. The problems for which a polynomial-bounded algorithm is available are listed and NP-completeness is established for a large number of other machine scheduling problems. We finally discuss some questions that remain unanswered.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the main existing approaches to propagate resource constraints in Constraint-Based scheduling and identifies some of their limitations for using them in an integrated planning and scheduling framework. We then describe two new algorithms to propagate resource constraints on discrete resources and reservoirs. Unlike most of the classical work in scheduling, our algorithms focus on the precedence relations between activities rather than on their absolute position in time. They are efficient even when the set of activities is not completely defined and when the time window of activities is large. These features explain why our algorithms are particularly suited for integrated planning and scheduling approaches. All our algorithms are illustrated with examples. Encouraging preliminary results are reported on pure scheduling problems as well as some possible extensions of our framework. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@book{Pinedo2012d,
abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

@article{Descotte1985c,
abstract = {Process planning consists in producing plans for manufacturing parts. It requires taking into account a great variety of pieces of knowledge. Most of them are not pure constraints, but preferences between which compromises are necessary. This is a situation which is typical of many real-life planning tasks. We have designed a planner which operates by iteratively constraining a loosely constrained initial plan built from the model of the part to be machined. If an inconsistent (i.e. overconstrained) plan is produced, then the planner makes use of a selective backtracking procedure which reasons about the weights attached to the applied constraints for deciding which compromise is 'best'. Successively applied constraints are drawn from 'pieces of advice' provided by an expert-type knowledge base. A system, gari, embedding this planner has been implemented and experimented for generating the machining plans of mechanical parts. Some plans were produced after several hundred constraints were applied, among which more than one hundred compromises were necessary. ?? 1985.},

@article{Johnston1992c,
abstract = {Creating an optimum long-term schedule for the Hubble Space Telescope is difficult by almost any standard due to the large number of activities, many relative and absolute time constraints, prevailing uncertainties and an unusually wide range of timescales. This problem has motivated research in neural networks for scheduling. The novel concept of continuous suitaility functions defined over a continuous time domain has been developed to represent soft temporal relationships between activities. All constraints and preferences are automatically translated into the weights of an appropriately designed artificial neural network. The constraints are subject to propagation and consistency enhancement in order to increase the number of explicitly represented constraints. Equipped with a novel stochastic neuron update rule, the resulting GDS-network effectively implements a Las Vegas-type algorithm to generate good schedules with an unparalleled efficiency. When provided with feedback from execution the network allows dynamic schedule revision and repair. ?? 1992.},

@article{Muscettola2002d,
abstract = {Computing tight resource-level bounds is a fundamental problem in the construction of flexible plans with resource utilization. In this paper we describe an efficient algorithm that builds a resource envelope, the tightest possible such bound. The algorithm is based on transforming the temporal network of resource consuming and producing events into a flow network with nodes equal to the events and edges equal to the necessary predecessor links between events. A staged maximum flow problem on the network is then used to compute the time of occurrence and the height of each step of the resource envelope profile. Each stage has the same computational complexity of solving a maximum flow problem on the entire flow network. This makes this method computationally feasible and promising for use in the inner loop of flexible-time scheduling algorithms.},

Associated with each job j is a known processing time a[SUBj] and a monotone nondecreasing cost function c[SUBj](t), giving the cost that is incurred by the completion of that job at time t.

The demonstration$\backslash$nof the integrated system as an on-board controller for Deep Space$\backslash$nOne, {\{}NASA's{\}} first New Millennium mission, is scheduled for a period$\backslash$nof a week in mid 1999.
