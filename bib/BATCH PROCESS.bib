@article{Voudouris1996a,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a method for the integrated scheduling and design for a special class of multipurpose batch proceses. The type of plants considered are the ones where not all the products use the same processing stages, and manufacturing of the products can be characterized through production routes. A novel representation for cyclic schedules is proposed that has the effect of aggregating the number of batches for each product. It is shown that the no-wait characteristics of substrains can be exploited with a reduction scheme that has the effect of greatly decreasing the dimensionality of the problem. This reduction scheme can be complemented with a tight formulation of the underlying disjunctions in the {\{}MILP{\}} to reduce the computational expense. The proposed {\{}MILP{\}} model for scheduling is extended to design problems in which the potential existence of intermediate storage in the production paths is also considered. In addition to the rigorous scheduling of the process, the sizes of the equipment constituting the various production stages are determined. By using exact linearization schemes it is shown that the problem can be reformulated as an {\{}MILP{\}} model and solved rigorously to global optimality. Application of the proposed model is illustrated with several example problems.},

@article{Majozi2001a,
abstract = {In this paper, a new concept, the so-called state sequence network representation, is presented. This representation is based on states only, eliminating the use of tasks and units. Using this new representation as a basis, a novel continuous-time MILP formulation for short-term scheduling of multipurpose batch plants is developed. The presented formulation can readily be extended to intermediate due date scenarios. Also presented in this paper is a new model for the duration constraints that explores degrees of freedom that are intrinsic in batch operations. These are due to operator intervention, raw material purity, and different catalyst types. Time points are used to denote the use or production of a particular state. This formulation leads to the least number of binary variables and much better results when compared to other continuous-time formulations published in the literature. The reduced number of binary variables is a result of considering states only, thereby eliminating binary variables corresponding to tasks and units. This method has been applied to literature examples and industrial problems which show significant improvement in reducing the number of binary variables and, hence, CPU times. The last section of this paper introduces the concept of units aggregation in reducing the binary dimension of large-scale problems. This makes it possible for the method to solve large-scale industrial problems. In the second paper of this series (Zhu, X. X.; Majozi, T. Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2001, 40, 5621-5634), it will be demonstrated how this formulation is applied in the context of integrated planning and scheduling},
