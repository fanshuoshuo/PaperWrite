abstract = {This paper describes how Coloured Petri Nets (CP-nets) have been developed â€” from being a promising theoretical model to being a full-fledged language for the design, specification, simulation, validation and implementation of large software systems (and other systems in which human beings and/or computers communicate by means of some more or less formal rules).},

@article{Bobbio1990a,
abstract = {Petri Nets (PN) are a graphical formalism which is gaining popularity in recent years as a tool for the representation of complex logical interactions (like synchronization, sequen- tiality, concurrency and conflict) among physical components or activities in a system. This notes are devoted to introduce the formalism of Petri nets with particular emphasis on the application of the methodology in the area of the performance and reliability modelling and analysis of sys- tems. The quantitative analysis of the behaviour of systems in time requires the superposition of a stochastic timing mechanism to the classical representation of PN. Timed Petri nets and, in particular, Stochastic Petri nets (SPN) are the object of the second part of the notes. Finally, some fully developed examples enlighten peculiar aspects which differentiate PNs from other mod- elling techniques usual in reliability analysis. In few words, the goal of these notes is to show that the proposed methodology based on the PN formalism can be conveniently used as a user-friendly language to represent and evaluate complex stochastic systems.},

@article{Oberweis1996a,
abstract = {The specification of an information system should include a description of structural system aspects as well as a description of the system behavior. In this article, we show how this can be achieved by high-level Petri netsnamely, the so-called NR/T-nets (Nested-Relation/Transition Nets). In NR/T-nets, the structural part is modeled by nested relations, and the behavioral part is modeled by a novel Petri net formalism. Each place of a net represents a nested relation scheme, and the marking of each place is given as a nested relation of the respective type. Insert and delete operations in a nested relational database (NF2-database) are expressed by transitions in a net. These operations may operate not only on whole tuples of a given relation, but also on subtuples of existing tuples. The arcs of a net are inscribed with so-called Filter Tables, which allow (together with an optional logical expression as transition inscription) conditions to be formulated on the specified (sub-) tuples. The occurrence rule for NR/T-net transitions is defined by the operations union, intersection, and negative in lattices of nested relations. The structure of an NR/T-net, together with the occurrence rule, defines classes of possible information system procedures, i.e., sequences of (possibly concurrent) operations in an information system.},
