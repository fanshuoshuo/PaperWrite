abstract = {—In times of global markets, the cost pressure on manufacturing companies in high-wage countries is increasing. One way to deal with globalized markets is to develop new production systems. The German Federal Government supports an initiative for the research on highly adaptable, cyber-physical production systems called Industrie 4.0. In cyber-physical production systems components communicate with assembly stations and other components to guarantee the ideal manufacturing process. As part of this initiative the description of communication and decision processes in the assembly systems is researched. Therefore a UML based modeling method is chosen to model the communications and material flows in such a system. The component data model is one central element in the process. In the model knowledge about the individual components can be stored and used to make decisions in the assembly process. During the communication process components exchange relevant knowledge, which is available in the component data model. This is required to define what components should be assembled to a final product and on which manufacturing station the work should be done. It guarantees low costs and a high flexibility in the assembly process. In this paper the relevance of the component data model in assembly processes and on the process models is shown.},

abstract = {The adoption of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in production networks enables new potential for improved efficiency, accountability, sustainability and scalability. In terms of production and transport processes, materialising this potential requires customised technological concepts, planning and control methods as well as business models. Even though CPS strongly rely on technological advancements, the creativity, flexibility and problem solving competence of human stakeholders is strongly needed for their operation. This paper introduces and reviews the social aspects of CPS and motivates future research towards Socio-Cyber-Physical Systems (SCPS) applied to production networks. In this frame, context-dependent behavioural aspects and implications related to the human stakeholders are delimitated. As a showcase for the relevance of these aspects the deficits arising from an insufficient communication among stakeholders in SCPS are analysed by means of a simulation experiment. The obtained results substantiate the dependence of SCPS on properly considering the aspects related to human stakeholders together with technology.},

@article{Verl2012a,
abstract = {Current developments in automation technol- ogy deal with ‘‘cyber physical systems''. These cyber physical systems have sensors and actors and can make decisions based on their own intelligence as well as par- tially adapt to changing conditions. For a versatile and networked production cyber physical systems are of lim- ited value. Precisely where the available sensors and actuators have to be combined flexibly due to ever new conditions, these systems find their limits because of their insularity. Limited computing hardware resources and lacking interfaces confine the possibilities of cyber physi- cal systems in production environment. This paper explains how cyber physical systems need to be developed further in order to meet the requirements of a versatile and networked production plant.},

@article{Rudtsch2014a,
abstract = {The application of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in production systems leads to Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) or the Smart Factory, respectively. In such an environment products, production resources as well as processes are each individually characterised by the special qualities of CPS. The current and future business potentials of production networks with decentralized coordination are enormous. However it is difficult for companies to keep track of the risks and chances of CPPS and develop appropriate business models. Therefore in this contribution a methodology for the pattern-based development and realization of business models in the context of Cyber-Physical Production Systems is presented. The methodology comprises three main modules that cover the most important aspects of business models for CPPS. In the first module patterns of established business models are gathered and their applicability in the context of CPPS is examined. The resulting library is then extended with patterns explicitly dedicated to CPPS and represents the base for a development procedure model. In the second module the developed business models are assessed with regard to their risks. For this purpose a method to analyse the risks of different business models and the perception of customers is elaborated. The focus of the third module is on the operationalization of abstract business models into company-specific business processes. It contains a design scheme to model value creation networks as well as typical configurations of these networks. The overall methodology is therefore supposed to make the opportunities of CPPS not only available to big corporations but also to small and medium-sized enterprises.},

Within this paper, a concept is presented how production systems can be discovered and included into an Industry 4.0 (I4.0) environment, even though they did not have I4.0-interfaces when they have been manufactured. The concept is based on a communication gateway and an information server. Besides the concept itself, this paper presents a validation that demonstrates applicability of the developed concept.},
