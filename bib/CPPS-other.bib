abstract = {The volatile globalised markets and mass customisation greatly affect modern industries. In this context, the timely and accurate manufacturing network design is an important strategic decision. However, this proven NP-hard problem cannot be approached by exhaustive methods. This research work aims to support the decision-makers by introducing a Genetic Algorithm for the identification of near optimum manufacturing network configurations. The examined problem tackles the multi-stage manufacturing network design for single customised products, through satisfaction of multiple objectives. The performance of the alternative designs deriving from the GA is compared to the results of an intelligent search algorithm with adjustable control parameters, and with an exhaustive search method. The conflicting criteria for evaluating the alternative configurations include cost, time, quality and environmental parameters. The applicability of the proposed method is validated through a case study, utilising data acquired from the automotive sector.},

@article{Schlick2009a,
abstract = {Industrial production is increasingly driven by megatrends like globalization, product individualization, shorter product life cycles and volatile markets. This means that production equipment and facilities have to be adapted to new products and product variants in less time. On a technical level, major challenges in factory automation are about shorter engineering phases, quicker ramp-up of production lines and connecting technical processes to business processes. Modern information and communication technologies can help to cope with these challenges. Cyber-Physical Systems - Embedded systems with decentralized control intelligence can establish communication through open networks based on internet protocols. This will lead to the replacement of classical hierarchical automation systems by self-organizing cyber physical production systems. In the near future, intelligent products themselves will become an active component within automated manufacturing systems. However, in order to let this vision come true, automation has to converge with IT. Component based automation will help to elevate the signal based point of view, which is a core concept of automation technology since decades to the level of semantic interoperability. Field bus technologies will converge with IP based network technologies opening the way for easy vertical integration. Context aware automation will automatically adapt production and logistics processes to new configuration requirements. Of course open communication and open interaction will lead to security issues that will have to be addressed on more than the technical level. While some of these technological changeovers already have begun, others are still on the level of academic research concepts. The before mentioned developments do have the potential to lead to disruptive changes in the way automation equipment is engineered and utilized. Cyber-physical production systems will drive industrial manufacturing to the digital-age and create technological as well as the organizational basis for the 4th industrial revolution.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity of products creates new challenges in produc- tion planning. Hence, the methodology of process development has to be designed valuable.Aninnovative approach to reach efficient planning consists in the virtualiza- tion of planning processes. Theconcept of the “DigitalFactory” enables a preliminary evaluation of the planning success. In the present work, a framework is presented, which allows for the integration of dedicated applications into an integrative data model to gain a holistic mapping of the production. Using Intelligence approaches, data can be analyzed to provide decision support and optimization potentials. The advantages involved are demonstrated by a production structure planning approach in connection with a process chain optimization.},

abstract = {The globalization of the world's economies is a major challenge to local industry and it is pushing the manufacturing sector to its next transformation – predictive manufacturing. In order to become more competitive, manufacturers need to embrace emerging technologies, such as advanced analytics and cyber-physical system-based approaches, to improve their efficiency and productivity. With an aggressive push towards “Internet of Things”, data has become more accessible and ubiquitous, contributing to the big data environment. This phenomenon necessitates the right approach and tools to convert data into useful, actionable information.},
